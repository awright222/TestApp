    domain: "westfield.edu", // for auto-assignment
    allowSelfRegistration: true,
    defaultStudentLimits: 1000,
    features: ["analytics", "bulk_import", "sso"]

  },
  admins: ["admin_user_id_1", "admin_user_id_2"],
  createdAt: "2025-01-01",
  metadata: {
    address: "...",
    contactEmail: "admin@westfield.edu"
  }
}
```

### Users Collection (Enhanced)
```javascript
{
  id: "user_123",
  email: "teacher@westfield.edu",
  displayName: "Sarah Johnson",
  organizationId: "org_123", // Primary organization
  roles: {
    "org_123": {
      role: "teacher", // admin, teacher, student
      permissions: ["create_classes", "manage_students", "view_analytics"],
      joinedAt: "2025-01-01",
      invitedBy: "admin_user_id_1"
    }
    // Users can belong to multiple orgs
  },
  profile: {
    avatar: "url...",
    department: "Science",
    title: "Biology Teacher"
  }
}
```

### Classes Collection (Enhanced)
```javascript
{
  id: "class_123",
  organizationId: "org_123", // Required
  teacherId: "user_123",
  name: "Biology 101",
  description: "Introduction to Biology",
  subject: "Science",
  settings: {
    enrollmentCode: "BIO101",
    allowSelfEnrollment: true,
    isArchived: false
  },
  enrolledStudents: [
    {
      studentId: "user_456",
      enrolledAt: "2025-01-01",
      status: "active" // active, suspended, completed

}
```

  'students.view_all_in_org': ['org_admin', 'teacher'],
  'students.manage_in_own_classes': ['teacher'],
