## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Component Architecture:**
```
AchievementSystem/
├── AchievementBadge.js (individual badge display)
├── AchievementManager.js (full achievement system)
├── AchievementDashboard.js (compact dashboard widget)
├── AchievementNotification.js (popup notifications)
├── AchievementsPage.js (full-page gallery)
